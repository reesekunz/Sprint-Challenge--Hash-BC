# * Think about what we can store in the hash table in order to help us to solve this problem more efficiently.
# * What if we store each weight in the input list as keys? What would be a useful thing to store as the value for each key?
# * If we store each weight's list index as its value, we can then check to see if the hash table contains an entry for `limit - weight`. If it does, then we've found the two items whose weights sum up to the `limit`!


# Example:
# ```
# input: weights = [4, 6, 10, 15, 16], length = 5, limit = 21
# output: [3, 1]
# since these are the indices of weights 15 and 6 whose sum equals 21

#  Hint:  You may not need all of these.  Remove the unused functions.

# Your function will return an instance of an `Answer` tuple that has the following form:
# ```
# (zero, one)
# ```
# where each element represents the item weights of the two packages. _**The higher valued index should be placed in the `zeroth` index and the smaller index should be placed in the `first` index.**_ If such a pair doesnâ€™t exist for the given inputs, your function should return `None`.
